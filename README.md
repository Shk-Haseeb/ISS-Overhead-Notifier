This Python script sends email alerts when the International Space Station (ISS) is visible overhead at night from your location. It uses the Open Notify API for real-time ISS tracking and the Sunrise-Sunset API to determine local darkness, checking conditions every 60 seconds to ensure timely notifications.

Simply enter your latitude, longitude, and email credentials to set up the script. You can run it locally or deploy it on a cloud service like PythonAnywhere for continuous operation. It's an easy and reliable tool for astronomy enthusiasts to spot the ISS from home.
